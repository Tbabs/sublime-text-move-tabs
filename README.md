Move Tabs
=========

Moves tabs in Sublime Text, like in Google Chrome.


Keybindings
-----------

**There are no Mac keybindings yet!**

If somebody knows how tabs are moved in Chrome on Mac, please let me know.

The default keybindings on Linux and Windows are:

*Ctrl+Shift+Page Up/Down* for moving tabs left/right.
